Homework repository at Otus Kotlin course

HomeTask 1:

- Create Kotlin project, add to git with code example.

HomeTask 2:

- 3 subtasks:

1) One number as an input - N. Program have to count sum of digits in this number.
2) One number as an input N - amount of minutes. Program have to convert minutes to amount of years and months that are
   not included to amount of years.
3) There is a rectangle with sides A and B. Calculate diagonal of the rectangle. Round result up to 3 digits after the
   dot.

HomeTask 3:

- 3 subtasks:

1) Count amount of days till the new year. Input is a number of Month and the number of day.If input is incorrect,
   error message should appear.
2) Input is whole prime number X < 100. Convert it to Roman number.
3) Input consists of 3 natural numbers - sides of triangle. Define type of triangle: right, obtuse, acute.

HomeTask 4:

- 3 subtasks:

1) Is input a palindrome? Checking is in separate function, output is true/false.
2) Write the function that counts factorial of the input. Factorial is a separate function.
3) Input is Int - amount of stages of an isosceles triangle. Write the function that draws the triangle of stars.

HomeTask 5:

- 3 subtasks:

1) Input is 4 integers. Write a method, that returns the minimum of them.
2) Input is 4 integers: x1, x2, y,1, у2 (-10000<x1,x2,y,1,у2<10000). Write a method, that returns the real number of
   type double - length of a segment with ends in points (x1,y1) и (x2,y2).
3) Write a method that validates a password. Password should be pretty complex and match next requirements:
    - Length minimum 6 symbols
    - At least 1 digit
    - At list 1 capital letter
    - Not allowed 3 identical symbols in a row

HomeTask 6:

- 6 subtasks:

1) Input is an integer N. Then input is N numbers space separated, each element is in range 0..100000. Output is this
   numbers from min to max
2) Input is 2 immutable arrays, implement 3 operations:
   - print combined array with all elements from the first one and then from the second one;
   - print the array, that contains elements from first array, that are not contained in the second array;
   - print crossed array, that contains all elements from the first and the second ones simultaneously;
3) Input is array, that contains at least one integer. Output is three numbers via space: minimal, average and maximum
   from the array.

HomeTask 7:

- Write the class, that describes fractional numbers (for example 1/2, 3/5 etc). Implement addition and subtraction
  methods of objects.

HomeTask 8:

- There is a UML diagram with text explanation. Implement its structure preserving inheritance, nesting and
  abstractness.
  It should be noted that some entities should be interfaces and some - abstract classes. Logic in methods should not be
  implemented, it is enough to make them compiled

HomeTask 9:

- Design the class architecture and implement all the required methods for the classes: Point, Line, Vector, BrokenCurve
  in accordance with description

HomeWork 10:

- 3 subtasks:

1) Implement function that consumes lambda function F and positive integer N. Function F has to start exactly N times.
2) Implement function (MAIN_F) that consumes lambda function F and returns the same result like F. Function MAIN_F has
   to be kind of wrapper for any other function and has to log time of start and end of input-function F.
